			<p><strong>Autism</strong> - a developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction, generally evident before age three, that adversely affects a student's educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences.Autism does not apply if a student's educational performance is adversely affected primarily because the student has an emotional behavioral disability.</p>

		<div>
			<p><strong>Developmental delay</strong> - relates to students, age 3-8, who experience developmental delays that adversely affect the student's educational performance as demonstrated on a standardized norm referenced test, with a test-retest or split-half reliability of .80 that is at least:</p>

			<p>(A) Two standard deviations below the mean in one or more of the five developmental areas; or
			(B) One and one-half standard deviations below the mean in two or more of the <strong>five developmental areas</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Cognitive development</strong>: Comprehending, remembering, and making sense out of one's experience. Cognitive ability is the ability to think and is often thought of in terms of intelligence;</li>

Infants and toddlers who qualify for early intervention services must be evaluated prior to age three in order to determine eligibility for special education and related services.<p>

			<p>Students who qualify under the developmental delay eligibility category must be re­evaluated before the age of nine and determined eligible for services under one of the other eligibility categories.</p>

		<h3 id="resourceHearingImpairments">Hearing Impairments</h3>
		<div>
			<p><strong>Hearing Impairment - </strong>defined by IDEA as "an impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational performance." The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), formerly the Education of the Handicapped Act (P.L. 94-142), includes "hearing impairment" and "deafness" as two of the categories under which children with disabilities may be eligible for special education and related services programming. While the term "hearing impairment" is often used generically to describe a wide range of hearing losses, including deafness, the regulations for IDEA define hearing loss and deafness separately.</p>

		<h3 id="resourceIntellectualDisabilities">Intellectual Disabilities</h3>
		<div>
			<p><strong>Intellectual Disabilities</strong> - a term used when a person has certain limitations in mental functioning and in skills such as communicating, taking care of him or herself, and social skills.

They will learn, but it will take them longer. There may be some things they cannot learn.</p>
